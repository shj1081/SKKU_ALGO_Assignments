# Computer Architecture Assignments

## Overview

This repository contains project assignments for the Computer Architecture course focused on RISC-V architecture. The assignments provide practical experience in different aspects of computer architecture.

## Projects Included

1. **Algorithm PA1: Min-Max-Median Priority Queue**

   - **Objective**: Implement a Min-Max-Median Priority Queue in C to efficiently find the minimum, maximum, and median elements.
   - **Required Functions**: `insert`, `delete_min`, `delete_max`, `delete_median`, `find_min`, `find_max`, `find_median`
   - **Input/Output**: Process operations on the priority queue and return results in a specified format.

2. **Algorithm PA2: Multiple Sequence Alignment**

   - **Goal**: Implement an algorithm to align multiple DNA sequences using a four-letter alphabet.
   - **Input/Output**: Read DNA sequences from `hw2_input.txt` and write alignment results to `hw2_output.txt`, marking identical alphabets across all sequences.

3. **Algorithm PA3: Dynamic Minimum Spanning Tree**

   - **Objective**: Design an algorithm to dynamically maintain the MST of an undirected graph as edges are inserted, deleted, or their weights changed.
   - **Input/Output**: Perform operations from `mst.in` and write the MST weight or 'Disconnected' to `mst.out`.
